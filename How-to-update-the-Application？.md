From time to time on app start TumblThree notifies you that there is a newer version available.

You can either let TumblThree download and install the new version for you or, if you prefer, 
you can do it manually:

* Just click on yes and the current zip archive will be downloaded.
* After its download go to the folder (e.g. Downloads) where you saved it.
* Right click the zip archive (e.g. TumblThree-v1.6.3-x64-Application.zip) and select "Extract All..." to use the windows built-in tool to extract the files, or use any other archive utility you like.
* Afterwards you will see a folder named "TumblThree", open it and, depending on the archive utility you have used, you might have to enter a second folder.
* Now select and copy all files inside this folder, go to your TumblThree's original folder and overwrite the files there.
* Afterwards you can delete the extracted folder and the zip archive, if you no longer need them.

Please keep in mind that you have to close TumblThree beforehand to be able to overwrite its files. And of course the shown way, is only one of the ways how to do it, follow whichever you prefer.

Alternatively you can download the zip archive by going to our website [tumblthreeapp.github.io](https://tumblthreeapp.github.io) or, if you should forget the url at one point, just use the "Check for Updates" button in the About dialog.
