## Translation of TumblThree into your own language:

* If you want to help translate TumblThree, there are two resource files (.resx) which contain all the strings used in the application. One for [the user interface](https://github.com/TumblThreeApp/TumblThree/blob/master/src/TumblThree/TumblThree.Presentation/Properties/Resources.resx#L120) and one for the [underlying application](https://github.com/TumblThreeApp/TumblThree/blob/master/src/TumblThree/TumblThree.Applications/Properties/Resources.resx#L120).
* Translate all the words or its meanings between the two value tags and create a pull request on github or simply send us the files via email.
