## To mass change the Crawler of all Tumblr Blogs, do the following:

* Open TumblThree
* Select all desired blogs in the manager (press "Ctrl-A" to select all blogs)
* Select the Details pane on the right
* in the Crawler combobox, select Tumblr SVC

This will change the Crawler of Tumblr blogs only (i.e. non-hidden, and hidden Tumblr blogs), but not to Liked-By downloads, or Tumblr Searches.

Note: You can also use the Shift/Ctrl key and the mouse to select multiple blogs at once.
