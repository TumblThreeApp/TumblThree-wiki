In the rare case that you want to uninstall the application, follow these steps.

* Delete the "installation" folder where the zip file was extracted to. Remember to keep the `Blogs` subfolder with your downloaded data, if you haven't changed the (default) download location in the (blog) settings.
* If you want to remove the settings as well, delete the TumblThree folder (%LOCALAPPDATA%\TumblThree) in your profile.

That's all.
